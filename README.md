## Portofolio Project
This portfolio was created as a homework assignment using a simple business question. The learning source I used to study data visualization is Satya Adnyana's YouTube channel, and I am using the same dataset as him.

## Data Source
Awesome Chocolates Dataset is collected from: https://linktr.ee/satyaadnyana

The data used is clean and ready to be utilized.
